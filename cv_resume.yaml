     Conduct Computational and Mathematical Neuroscience research under the supervision of Dr. Andrey Shilnikov, Ph.D. The study focuses on reconstructing time series data using nonlinear dynamical systems for nonlinear regression in Python and MatLabMATLAB. The goal is to solve for the optimal initial conditions of the hyperparameters. Methods used to reconstruct time-series data concentrate around implementing various deep learning algorithms, Gradient Descent Methods, Secant Methods, and multiple heuristic optimization methods.
    bullets:  
    - Research the application of optimization methods and neural networks on nonlinear dynamical systems
    - Created visualizations of higher-dimensional parameter space used to illustrate parameter space.
